# Chatbot Project

## Project Overview

This chatbot is designed to detect emotions from user input and respond accordingly. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment and classify emotions into categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, and Neutral.

## Agile Approach

This project follows an Agile development methodology, specifically using the SCRUM framework. The development process was divided into three sprints:

### Sprint 1: Project Initialization & Basic Functionality

- Set up project repository
- Implement basic chatbot structure
- Integrate sentiment analysis using NLTK
- Test emotion detection with predefined inputs

### Sprint 2: Enhancements & Testing

- Improve emotion detection logic
- Add unit tests to validate chatbot functionality
- Enhance chatbot responses
- Conduct usability testing

### Sprint 3: Finalization & Documentation

- Optimize sentiment analysis algorithm
- Improve chatbot response accuracy
- Finalize project documentation
- Prepare README and user guide

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- NLTK library installed (`pip install nltk`)

### Running the Chatbot

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
